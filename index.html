                        I am currently finishing my degree in Software Engineering at the University of Victoria. 
                        I have worked as a developer at Rimex Supply Ltd. as well as Ergonomyx Inc. In these 
                        positions, I have had the opportunity to work on many interesting projects and have 
                        gained many skills with them. While going to school at the University of Victoria, I
                        had the chance to work with both the Satalite Design Club, as well as the Biomedical 
                        Design Club. If you would like to know more about anything I have listed here, Please use
                        the links in the navbar to find what you're looking for, or just scroll down.

                        During my co-op at Ergonomyx, my primary job was to develop voice assistance 
                        into Ergonomyx's products. The main project that I worked on was developing a
                        proprietary voice assist for one Ergonomyx's new products. In doing this,
                        I was very involved in all aspects of the project, everything from creating web 
                        app to collect the voice samples to implementing a convolutional neural network
                        in an embedded application. This project involved developing a language model 
                        using TensorFlow, creating a web application using Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, 
                        and was deployed on heroku with the database on AWS.

                        Another project I was a part of was integrating Alexa and Google Home Assistant into 
                        their standing-desk. In this project I created the web-server that handled the business
                        logic of the commands sent from the Google Home or Alexa. At the time I finished with the
                        the project, the voice app had most of the functionality that the mobile app did. 
                        The application also required authentication using an OAuth 2 server which I had a small role
                        in developing. This project involved deplying the voice application on AWS, using AWS IoT Core, 
                        Node.js, and Python's Flask.

                        In my time working for TyreSense, I had two main roles, the first of which was 
                        repairing some of the RMA items and assembling new products, and the second of which 
                        was to develop TyreSenses inventory management system. In developing the inventory 
                        management system, a coworker and I developed a web server using Flask and MySQL for 
                        the backend, and JQuery and HTML/CSS for the front end.

                       The electronics assistant role I had at TyreSense required me to assemble and upload 
                       code to the PCBs. This role required soldering and replacing different modules, resistors
                       and capacitors to the PCBs, as well as using a multimeter to verify the voltages coming 
                       from different sections of the board.
